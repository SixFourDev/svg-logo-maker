## Installation

To be able to use this tool, simply clone the repo from https://github.com/SixFourDev/svg-logo-maker, then open it in VS Code. After you have opened it in VS Code, open your terminal in VS Code by right clicking "index.js" then click "Open in Integrated Terminal". The terminal will then present itself at the bottom of VS Code. Once you have the terminal opened, you will want to run "npm install" to install the packages needed to be able to use this tool.

## Usage

To use this tool, you will right click "index.js" in your VS Code, then click "Open in Integrated Terminal". This will open the terminal to the appropriate file where you will then run the code "node index". You will then be prompted to enter text up to three characters, the color of your text, choose from a list of shapes (circle, triangle, square), and the color you would like for the shape. After you have entered all the prompted questions, it will display 'Generated logo.svg" in the console, and you will see a new svg created on the left side of your VS Code called "logo.svg". You can right click "logo.svg" and click "Open Preview" and you will see the logo you have created!
